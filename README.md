## Introduction

Linear regression is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning and statistics. It models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. This notebook provides a practical example of implementing linear regression from scratch.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need the following packages:

- Python 3.8 or later
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:

Usage
1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linear-regression-model.git
cd linear-regression-model

2. Open the Jupyter notebook:

jupyter notebook "Machine Learning Lr_model.ipynb"

3. Execute the cells in the notebook to see the linear regression model in action.

Notebook Overview
The notebook is organized into the following sections:

1. Imports and Data Preparation: Import necessary libraries and prepare the dataset.
2. Model Implementation: Implement the linear regression model from scratch.
3. Training and Evaluation: Train the model on the training dataset and evaluate its performance on the test dataset.
4. Visualization: Plot the results to visualize the model's predictions.
5. Cost Function Calculation: Compute the cost function to assess the model's accuracy.

Results
The notebook plots the predictions of the linear regression model against the actual data points, and calculates the cost function to quantify the model's performance.
